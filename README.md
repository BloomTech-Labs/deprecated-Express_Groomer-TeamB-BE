 ## Back End Documentation

See the [Backend Documentation Generated in Postman](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/10971957/TVzViwNL) for details on the interacting with the backend of the project. 

You can import the entire Postman Collection via this button: 


[![Run in Postman](https://run.pstmn.io/button.svg)](https://app.getpostman.com/run-collection/f34416839ea9be987e33)

**`NOTE:`**  neither this documentation nor the Postman collection include the authentication headers with the Bearer Token needed to access protected routes.  

For this reason, currently routes have been tested in Postman in a local environment by first removing the authrequired middleware.  If you choose to do so, do NOT forget to restore the middleware to any routes you are testing. And do NOT commit any such changes to the backend.  This is not best practice. If there is a way to get OKTA auth recognized in Postman, feel free to attempt it.  Alternatively you might research using Insomnia with Okta auth.

## Getting Started
<br>

For steps on how to work with this repository [please see here](https://docs.labs.lambdaschool.com/labs-spa-starter/)

<br>


### Environment Variables (Original Setup Instructions)

- `PORT` - API port (optional, but helpful with FE running as well)
  - The following ports are whitelisted for use with okta
    - 3000
    - 8000
    - 8080
- `DATABASE_URL` - connection string for postgres database
- `OKTA_URL_ISSUER` - The complete issuer URL for verifying okta access tokens. `https://example.okta.com/oauth2/default`
- `OKTA_CLIENT_ID` - the okta client ID.

See `.env` file for example values

### Setup postgres

There are 3 options to get postgresql installed locally [Choose one]:

1. Use docker. [Install](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) for your platform
   - run: `docker-compose up -d` to start up the postgresql database and pgadmin.
   - Open a browser to [pgadmin](http://localhost:5050/) and you should see the Dev server already defined.
   - If you need to start over you will need to delete the folder `$ rm -rf ./data/pg` as this is where all of the server data is stored.
     - if the database `api-dev` was not created then start over.
2. Download and install postgresql directly from the [main site](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
   - make note of the port, username and password you use to setup the database.
   - Connect your client to the server manually using the values previously mentioned
   - You will need to create a database manually using a client.
   - Make sure to update the DATABASE_URL connection string with the values for username/password, databasename and server port (if not 5432).
3. Setup a free account at [ElephantSQL](https://www.elephantsql.com/plans.html)
   - Sign up for a free `Tiney Turtle` plan
   - copy the URL to the DATABASE_URL .env variable
   - make sure to add `?ssl=true` to the end of this url

### Setup the application

- create your project repo by forking or using this as a template.
- run: `npm install` to download all dependencies.
- confirm correct env variables in your `.env` file.
- run: `npm run knex migrate:latest` to create the starting schema.
- run: `npm run knex seed:run` to populate your db with some data.
- run: `npm run tests` to confirm all is setup and tests pass.
- run: `npm run watch:dev` to start nodemon in local dev enviornment.
